  <h2>Description</h2>

    brunch offering.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>...</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <!-- Step 01 -->
    <li>
      <p>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook spaghetti pasta until al dente. Drain well. Toss with 1 tablespoon
        of olive oil, and set aside.</p>
    </li>

    <!-- Step 02 -->
    <li>
      <p>Meanwhile in a large skillet, cook chopped bacon until slightly crisp; remove and drain onto paper towels.
        Reserve 2 tablespoons of bacon fat; add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, and heat in reused large skillet. Add
        chopped onion, and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic, and cook 1 minute more.
        Add wine if desired; cook one more minute.</p>
    </li>

    <!-- Step 03 -->
    <li>
      <p>eturn cooked bacon to pan; add cooked and drained spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive
        oil if it seems dry or is sticking together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or large
        fork until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and toss again. Add salt and pepper to
        taste (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</p>
    </li>

    <!-- Step 04 -->
    <li>
      <p>Serve immediately with chopped parsley sprinkled on top, and extra Parmesan cheese at table.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
